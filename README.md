# Ap_Lab4_Local_Spider
Introduction:
In this lab we have to create a spider (also known as crawler) application capable of indexing the local file system. The spider should crawl through the file system, creating an easily searchable index of file paths, file names & contents. The user should then be able to search this index against keyword, getting back all the file paths where the keyword was encountered. 

How to Run:

	Compile Lab4 class. It will ask you to enter string which you want to search. It will search that string from file names and also from contents of file.
	To run test cases run Lab4Test.
